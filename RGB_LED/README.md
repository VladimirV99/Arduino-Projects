# RGB LED

## Description

Changing color demo with an RGB LED with a common cathode.

## Notes

All three color controlling pins have to be connected to PWM pins. The R, G and B values have to be between 0 and 255.

## Wiring

The longest pin is connected to the ground. On one side of it is the red pin, and on the other are green and blue pins in increasing distance. The red pin is connected to Arduino pin 9, the green pin to Arduino pin 10 and the blue pin to Arduino pin 11, all of them through a 220ohm resistor.
